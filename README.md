# Price_Range_Classification
## Price Classification Project
Course: NLP (Semester 6) - Pillai College of Engineering

### Project Overview
This project is part of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) course for Semester 6 students at Pillai College of Engineering. The objective of this project is to classify products into predefined price ranges based
on textual descriptions and other relevant features.We leverage various Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Language Models to analyze product descriptions, extracting meaningful insights that help categorize items into appropriate price bands. The project involves key NLP techniques such as text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation to ensure accurate classification.Through this project, students will gain hands-on experience in working with real-world datasets, applying state-of-the-art models, and optimizing performance for price prediction tasks.
