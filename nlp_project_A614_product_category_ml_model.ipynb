        "* For future improvements, implementing deep learning models such as LSTMs, GRUs, or Transformers (e.g., BERT) can significantly enhance sequential pattern recognition, enabling the model to better understand word dependencies and contextual meaning. Additionally, advanced feature engineering techniques like Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and sentiment analysis can provide richer linguistic insights, improving classification accuracy by capturing the intent and structure of the text more effectively. Moreover, to address class imbalance issues, techniques such as data augmentation, oversampling, or cost-sensitive learning should be applied to ensure the model does not favor majority classes, leading to a more balanced and fair prediction system. By integrating these advancements, the overall performance and generalizability of the model can be significantly improved for real-world applications.\n",
